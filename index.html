        <h2>My favorite character in "Spy School" is Erica, a 16 year old, talented teenager who has been learning to spy in Spy School for her whole life. She is extremly skilled in many aspects: she can tie difficult knots, disassemble bombs, remember a whole entire book and map easily, fight off a full grown adult singlehandedly, and has an amazing acting ability. She is very cold and distant from other people, so people nicknamed her "Ice Queen". In the series of "Spy School", she always helps Ben, the main character of the story, on his missions. Ben is her best friend, though even despite that, she barely ever communicates to him unless on missions or occasionally just to check in or tell him something. She's also friends with Zoe, who was the one who nicknamed her "Ice Queen". Erica is described as the most beautiful girl Ben has ever seen in his life. Erica has raven black hair and ice blue eyes, as described in the book. According to spy school, Erica has started training to become a spy at a very young age, as she came from a long line of succesful, legendary spies.</h2>
